## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv quantvenv

# Activate environment
source quantvenv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
source quantvenv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Google Sheets Configuration
1. **Create Google Cloud Project**: Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Enable Sheets API**: Enable Google Sheets API for your project
3. **Create Service Account**: Create credentials → Service Account
4. **Download JSON**: Save as `credentials.json` in project root
5. **Create Google Sheet**: Create sheet with 3 tabs: "Trade Log", "Portfolio Summary", "Performance Metrics"
6. **Share Sheet**: Share with service account email (Editor access)

### 3. Configuration
Update `main.py` with your Google Sheet URL:
```python
SHEET_URL = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit"
```

## 📈 Trading Strategy

### Signal Generation
- **Buy Signal**: RSI < 30 (oversold) AND 20-day MA > 50-day MA (bullish trend)
- **Sell Signals**: 
  - RSI > 50 (momentum reversal)
  - 20-day MA < 50-day MA (trend reversal)
  - 30-day time limit (risk management)

### Risk Management
- **Position Sizing**: Maximum 30% of capital per stock
- **Transaction Costs**: 0.1% per trade (realistic brokerage)
- **Stop Loss**: Implicit through trend reversal signals
- **Diversification**: Equal allocation across 3 NIFTY 50 stocks

## 🤖 Machine Learning Components

### Features Used
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, Moving Averages (20-day, 50-day)
- **Price Metrics**: Price changes, High/Low ratios
- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume patterns
- **Derived Features**: MA ratios, momentum indicators

### Models Implemented
1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Max depth: 5 (prevents overfitting)
   - Features ranked by importance
   - Typical accuracy: 40-60%

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Baseline linear model
   - L2 regularization
   - Probability-based predictions

### Prediction Target
- **Binary Classification**: Next-day price direction (Up/Down)
- **Training/Test Split**: 80/20 with stratification
- **Validation**: Out-of-sample testing on recent data

## 📊 Google Sheets Integration

### Tab 1: Trade Log
- Date, Symbol, Action (BUY/SELL)
- Shares, Price, Total Value
- Portfolio Value at trade time

### Tab 2: Portfolio Summary  
- Total stocks analyzed
- Average return across portfolio
- Total trades executed
- Average ML model accuracy
- Best/worst performing stocks
- Real-time timestamps

### Tab 3: Performance Metrics
- Individual stock returns
- Number of trades per stock
- Win rates and success metrics
- Last updated timestamps

## 📈 Sample Results

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Realistic Expectations
- Returns shown are backtested results, not live trading guarantees
- ML accuracies of 40-60% are realistic for stock prediction
- System includes transaction costs for realistic P&L calculations
- Strategy is conservative with risk management built-in

### Production Considerations
- This is a prototype for demonstration purposes
- Real trading would require additional risk controls
- Paper trading recommended before live implementation
- Regular model retraining needed for production use

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Immediate Improvements
- [ ] Telegram alert integration (bonus feature)
- [ ] Advanced logging with rotating files
- [ ] Configuration file for easy parameter tuning
- [ ] Extended backtesting with multiple timeframes

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Real-time streaming data integration
- [ ] Portfolio optimization algorithms
- [ ] Advanced ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- [ ] Multi-asset class support
- [ ] Risk-adjusted performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown)
